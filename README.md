Objective:

The primary objective of the E-commerce Sales Analysis Excel Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and visually appealing platform for stakeholders to gain valuable insights into the company's sales and profitability. The dashboard aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making by presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable information in a user-friendly format.

Problem Statement:

While overall sales and profit figures are positive, the negative YoY growth in profit margin requires attention. The dashboard aims to address this by providing a detailed breakdown of sales and profit, enabling stakeholders to identify specific areas of improvement.
